<p style="font-family:comic sans ms">"As a statistician with ERC, my job involves analysis and prediction. Analysing large amounts of data captured from various functions and using that to predict failure rates, costs and warranty. When I joined Tata Motors I had a very academic approach to this subject. But over the years, my job has taught me to be more practical  and has trained me to apply the knowledge that I have amassed through my experience. In addition, working at Tata Motors also exposes me to a lot of new learnings and constantly enriches my knowledge on the subject."
</br>- Harini Srivastava, ERC (Pune)</p>

<p style="font-family:comic sans ms">"As a CSR member of Tata Motors, I  have realised that volunteering not only helps corporates give back to society, but also reveals the considerate and generous character of an individual. The more efforts you make, the more you receive in terms of learning, experience and contentment. Make a difference and experience the joy of giving. As they say, 'No one can do everything, but everyone can do something."
